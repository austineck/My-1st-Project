I plan on following the instructions as described to us during class to be able to break it down in smaller steps, which will make it easier for me to follow. 
The resources I plan on using to help me create this script is the Linux textbook as well as online help. I will be the one who owns the code, and changes will be
applied frequently to this project by me using git.
